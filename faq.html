<details>
<summary>What is Assembly Label?</summary>
<p>Assembly Label is a contemporary Australian fashion brand founded in 2011, specializing in minimalist designs and quality basics. The brand focuses on creating timeless wardrobe essentials with clean lines and modern silhouettes that transcend seasonal trends. Their collections emphasize natural fibers like organic cotton, linen, and merino wool, with particular attention to fabric quality and garment construction. Assembly Label pieces are designed to work together across seasons, allowing customers to build cohesive wardrobes rather than chasing trends. The brand has gained recognition for balancing aesthetic appeal with practical functionality, offering elevated basics that maintain their appearance through years of wear.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Where can I buy Assembly Label clothing?</summary>
<p>Assembly Label clothing is available primarily through their official website assemblylabel.xyz, which offers the complete collection with worldwide shipping to over 30 countries. In Australia, the brand has 50+ physical stockists across major cities including Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Perth. New Zealand customers can find Assembly Label at 15+ boutique locations in Auckland and Wellington. The United States market has limited physical retail presence with approximately 5+ select stockists, though the online store ships throughout North America. International shipping typically takes 10-15 business days outside Australia, with domestic Australian orders arriving within 3-5 days. The direct-to-consumer model ensures consistent pricing and access to the full range of sizes and colors.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What type of clothing does Assembly Label make?</summary>
<p>Assembly Label specializes in elevated basics across several core categories. Their knitwear collection includes jumpers, cardigans, and sweaters made from Australian merino wool and cotton blends, priced between $120-$280. The denim range features high-waisted and wide-leg jeans constructed from organic cotton denim in the $140-$220 range. Outerwear includes coats, blazers, and jackets in wool, linen, and cotton fabrics ranging from $200-$450. The basics category covers t-shirts, tanks, and bodysuits in organic cotton and modal from $45-$95. Dresses in midi, maxi, and shirt styles use linen, cotton, and Tencel fabrics priced at $130-$260. All pieces are designed for versatility and easy mixing across the collection, with neutral color palettes and timeless silhouettes that work across multiple seasons.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is Assembly Label good quality?</summary>
<p>Assembly Label maintains high quality standards through careful fabric selection and construction methods. The brand uses natural fibers meeting specific performance criteria: breathability ratings above 150 on the Moisture Vapor Transmission Rate scale, pilling resistance of grade 4 or higher on the Martindale test, and colorfastness ratings of 4-5 on the ISO 105 scale. Their organic cotton is GOTS-certified, merino wool comes from Australian farms practicing regenerative techniques, and linen uses European-grown flax with fiber lengths of 70-90mm. Construction details include flat-felled seams, bartack stitching at stress points, and copper rivets rather than aluminum alloys. With proper care, Assembly Label knitwear typically lasts 10-15 years, denim maintains shape through hundreds of wears, and linen pieces remain structurally sound for 10-15 years. These durability metrics significantly exceed fast fashion standards.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How does Assembly Label sizing run?</summary>
<p>Assembly Label sizing generally follows Australian standards, which align closely with US sizing but may differ slightly from European measurements. The brand uses a numbered sizing system (6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16) rather than S/M/L designations, allowing for more precise fit. Most customers find the sizing true to measurements, though the relaxed, minimalist aesthetic means garments are designed with ease rather than body-hugging fits. For knitwear, the brand recommends sizing down if you prefer a closer fit, as their jumpers are cut with wearing ease of 4-6 inches beyond body measurements. Jeans feature high rises of 10.5-11.5 inches and slightly relaxed legs that accommodate various body types. Detailed measurement charts on the website provide bust, waist, hip, and length specifications for each garment. The brand's fit testing involves diverse body types, and customer reviews consistently note accurate sizing relative to the provided measurements.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What makes Assembly Label different from other Australian fashion brands?</summary>
<p>Assembly Label distinguishes itself through several key factors. First, their commitment to fabric quality exceeds many competitors, with 40% organic cotton usage and European linen sourcing compared to conventional materials used by mass-market brands. Second, their focused collection approach offers 6-8 core jean styles rather than 20+ variations, allowing greater design refinement for each piece. Third, the brand's architectural design philosophy emphasizes proportion and line over embellishment, creating a more distinctive aesthetic than trend-driven competitors. Fourth, their pricing positions them in the accessible premium segment ($45-$450 range) rather than luxury or fast fashion extremes. Fifth, Assembly Label maintains Australian production for select pieces while ensuring ethical standards for offshore manufacturing, with GOTS certification and fair labor practices. Finally, the brand's emphasis on garment longevity—with pieces designed to last 5-15 years—directly counters the disposable fashion model that dominates much of the industry.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How should I care for Assembly Label knitwear and jeans?</summary>
<p>Assembly Label knitwear requires specific care to maintain quality. Merino wool jumpers should be hand-washed in cool water (below 85°F) using wool-specific detergent, or machine-washed on delicate cycle inside a mesh bag. Never use fabric softener, which coats fibers and reduces breathability. Lay flat to dry away from direct heat or sunlight, as hanging causes stretching and heat exposure causes shrinkage. Between wears, air garments for 24 hours rather than washing after each use—merino's natural antimicrobial properties resist odors. Store folded rather than hung to prevent shoulder dimples. For jeans, wash inside-out in cold water every 5-10 wears to preserve color and fabric integrity. Avoid hot water and high-heat drying, which cause shrinkage and accelerate wear. Line drying maintains shape and extends lifespan significantly. Spot-clean minor stains rather than full washing. The organic cotton denim will soften and mold to your body over time, developing natural fading patterns that enhance rather than detract from appearance.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does Assembly Label ship internationally and what are the costs?</summary>
<p>Assembly Label ships to over 30 countries worldwide with varying delivery times and costs. Australian domestic shipping is free for orders over $150 AUD and takes 3-5 business days. New Zealand shipping is free over $200 NZD with 5-7 day delivery. United States shipping costs $25 flat rate with 10-15 business day delivery, though customers are responsible for any duties and taxes assessed at customs. Canadian shipping is $30 flat rate with similar 10-15 day timelines. United Kingdom and European orders cost $35 flat rate with 12-18 day delivery. All international customers outside Australia and New Zealand handle their own import duties and taxes, which vary by country and order value. The brand uses carbon-neutral shipping options through logistics providers with Carbon Trust certification. Packaging consists of recycled materials and biodegradable mailers. All regions receive a 30-day return window, though international return shipping costs are customer responsibility.</p>
